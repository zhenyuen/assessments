# About
This is a repository of some of my re-attempts at software-engineering interviews.


# Why
I've recently completed my internship and Visa as an software engineer.
Compounded with some of the online assessments I have recently taken, I have
came to realize my main weakness as an software engineer -- that is the
ability to understand and balance the trade-off between writing quick & dirty
code versus writing the `perfect` code.

I have always appreciated how learning data-structure & algorithms does strengthen
my foundations in becoming a better software-engineer. As much as I had the 
opportunity to interact with low level C/C++ codes at ARM, my internship as a
backend engineer at Visa mostly revovle around using the right libraries, and keeping the 
codes as simple or maintainable as possible. Rarely I had the chance to apply
what I have learnt from DSA.

And there -- I was wrong. When faced to write code in which libraries do no exist,
my bad habits do takeover -- and I end up writing rather ineffici
